# 1)Take any .txt file and run datagen.py to create data.csv 
# 2)use 1 encryption function on data.csv to create data1.csv ,then another encryption function and create data2.csv likewise
# 3)run model.py between subsequent datasets to respective .pth files
# 4)run decode.py at each level using .pth to decode entire test set
# 5)use gpt2 on decoded and clean text to train gpt model
# 6)run run.py on encrypted text to get decoded and subsequent corrected text
